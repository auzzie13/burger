# burger
With this app the user can look at a list of burgers and decide if they would like to "devour" the burger.

the user can add to the list of burger choices by adding a burger name in the input box at the bottom of the page.

after a burger has been added to the list, user can then decide to delete a burger from the list, or "devour" it.

bugs:
delete route not working
post route not working
new burger data coming back as null
